# AbstractVM
A simple virtual machine in C++ that can interpret instructions written in a basic assembly language and execute them. It acts as a basic calculator.  
  
#### Building  
`make`

#### Run  
Run the `avm` binary alone to pass instructions through standard input. Or pass a file containing instructions as a parameter.
